# change the fastp merged tag to BAM format tag fm:Z: for passing through minimap2 as fastq
# count reads and bases to assess what fastp filtering and merging did to prepare_fastq.pl output
# final QNAME output tag format is:
#   QNAME [any previous tags] fm:Z:mergeLevel:nRead1:nRead2
# where:
#     fm indicates "fastp merge"
#     mergeLevel, 
#         2 for fastp-merged reads (highest priority on sorting)
#         0 for single, unmerged, or orphaned reads
#             mergeLevel may later be adjusted to 1 if subjected to downstream alignment-guided merging
#     nRead1, the number of read1 bases present in a final merged read (0 for single, unmerged or orphan reads)
#     nRead2, the number of read2 bases present in a final merged read

# from https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp?tab=readme-ov-file#merge-paired-end-reads

# In the output file, a tag like merged_xxx_yyy will be added to each read name 
# to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. 
# For example,  
#     @NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15 
# means that 
#     150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2
# fastp prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2.
